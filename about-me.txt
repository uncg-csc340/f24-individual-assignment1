I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have an MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, and a BS in Computer
Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. I like (some) superheroes and puzzles. Just
like most basic people, I like hiking. I also like history tidbits (ask me about my favorite
podcasts). I'm currently reading Failure Is An Option by H. Jon Benjamin (Bob's Burgers)
This is the way.

Nandor DeLaurentis
---------------------------------------------------------
I was a very ferocious warrior in the Ottoman Empire, which meant doing a lot of things. A lot
of pillaging. People would say 'hey please don’t pillage me' and I would say 'nooooo, I’m
pillaging everyone, you included'. I was relentless. They would call me Nandor The Relentless.
Because I just never relent.

I am a junior in Computer Science at UNCG. I am from Las Vegas, Nevada and lived there until I
started college. I am now married and I have little free time, but when I do get free time I love
to play Elden Ring or Lies of P. I am currently reading The Hobbit, and will proceed to read
The Lord of the Rings series when I complete it.

I am Computer Science student at UNCG. I am in my last year and going for my Bachelors degree.
My coding skills arent the best but im trying hard to improve them. I like video games, music,
and soccer. I hope to learn a lot from this class!

I am currently getting my Computer Science degree form UNCG. I like both listening and
playing music. One of my favorite ways to pass the time is to sleep. I also enjoy reading
and the book I am current reading is "The One Thing" by Gary Keller.
