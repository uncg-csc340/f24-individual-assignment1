Nandor DeLaurentis
---------------------------------------------------------
I was a very ferocious warrior in the Ottoman Empire, which meant doing a lot of things. A lot
of pillaging. People would say 'hey please don’t pillage me' and I would say 'nooooo, I’m
pillaging everyone, you included'. I was relentless. They would call me Nandor The Relentless.
Because I just never relent.

Bennett Scott
---------------------------------------------------------
I am a student of Computer Science pursuing his BS at the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro. I am also an IT Innovations Team intern at AAA, where I design prototypes and build
websites. It's my duty to write software that is optimized, efficient, and useful to the
end-user. I truly believe in the Unix philosophy, which is to avoid complexity in software
projects by building specific applications that are each designed to solve one specific problem
well, rather than filling them with bloat by trying to solve multiple problems at once. Software
I am a student of Computer Science pursuing his BS at the University of North Carolina at
development is my true calling; I want to build as many applications as I can in my lifetime.
One day, I want to be able to confidently see myself as one of the new-age architects of digital
spaces that we call software engineers.

I also like playing Dungeons & Dragons.
