I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have an MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, and a BS in Computer
Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. I like (some) superheroes and puzzles. Just
like most basic people, I like hiking. I also like history tidbits (ask me about my favorite
podcasts). I'm currently reading Failure Is An Option by H. Jon Benjamin (Bob's Burgers)
This is the way.

I was a very ferocious warrior in the Ottoman Empire, which meant doing a lot of things. A lot
of pillaging. People would say 'hey please don’t pillage me' and I would say 'nooooo, I’m
pillaging everyone, you included'. I was relentless. They would call me Nandor The Relentless.
Because I just never relent.

I am a student of Computer Science (obviously). I enjoy reading philosophy and therefore I am
getting a minor in philosophy. I love watching most sports and playing some sports, mainly
soccer and basketball.  LeBron James is my G.O.A.T. in my humble opinion. I enjoy my weekends
by playing games on my PC and spent most of summer trying to beat the DLC of Elden Ring.
And I was successful a week before school started, just in time!
