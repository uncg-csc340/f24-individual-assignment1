I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have an MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, and a BS in Computer
Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. I like (some) superheroes and puzzles. Just
like most basic people, I like hiking. I also like history tidbits (ask me about my favorite
podcasts). I'm currently reading Failure Is An Option by H. Jon Benjamin (Bob's Burgers)
This is the way.

Nandor DeLaurentis
---------------------------------------------------------
I was a very ferocious warrior in the Ottoman Empire, which meant doing a lot of things. A lot
of pillaging. People would say 'hey please don’t pillage me' and I would say 'nooooo, I’m
pillaging everyone, you included'. I was relentless. They would call me Nandor The Relentless.
Because I just never relent.
